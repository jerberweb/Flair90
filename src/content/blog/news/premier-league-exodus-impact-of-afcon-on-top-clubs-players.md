As the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) approaches, Premier League clubs are bracing themselves for the departure of key players who will be representing their nations in this prestigious tournament. The event, scheduled from January 13 to February 11, coincides with the Asian Cup, presenting a unique challenge for clubs with players participating in both competitions. This article takes a closer look at the impact on Premier League teams, focusing on the notable players set to feature in AFCON.

### Arsenal
Arsenal will be without the services of Mohamed Elneny (Egypt), a key midfielder heading to AFCON. However, the Gunners can breathe a sigh of relief as the injured Thomas Partey has not been selected by Ghana. Japanese defender Takehiro Tomiyasu has also expressed concern about the scheduling clash between AFCON and the 2027 Asian Cup.

### Aston Villa
Bertrand Traoré (Burkina Faso) is the only departure for Aston Villa, having last made a league appearance in October. With adequate cover on the right wing, Villa remains optimistic about coping with Traoré's absence.

### Bournemouth
Despite some injury concerns, Bournemouth is set to send Dango Ouattara (Burkina Faso) and Antoine Semenyo (Ghana) to AFCON. However, the club suffered a setback with the withdrawal of Hamed Traorè from Ivory Coast's squad due to recovery from malaria.

### Brentford
Brentford faces a significant blow with the absence of key players like Yoane Wissa (DR Congo) and Frank Onyeka (Nigeria). With Ivan Toney and Bryan Mbeumo already sidelined, the team's depth will be put to the test.

### Brighton
Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma (Japan) is a crucial player set to feature in the Asian Cup. However, concerns over Simon Adingra's (Ivory Coast) participation have been dispelled, as the winger refuted rumors that Brighton was preventing him from joining AFCON.

### Burnley
Burnley stands out as one of the few teams not losing any players to AFCON, with Lyle Foster's omission from South Africa's squad due to mental health grounds.

### Chelsea
Nicolas Jackson (Senegal) is Chelsea's sole representative in AFCON, and the club hopes he can contribute to Senegal's title defense. The striker will be missed during his absence.

### Crystal Palace
Jordan Ayew (Ghana) is set to participate in his sixth AFCON, joining his brother André at the tournament. Crystal Palace values Ayew's intelligence and unselfish running, making his absence noteworthy.

### Everton
Idrissa Gueye (Senegal) is among the six Premier League players in Senegal's squad, while Abdoulaye Doucouré turned down Mali's call-up to focus on Everton's relegation fight.

### Fulham
Calvin Bassey (Nigeria) makes his AFCON debut for Nigeria, while Alex Iwobi (Nigeria) features in his third tournament. Fodé Ballo-Touré (Senegal) is another Fulham player set to participate in AFCON.

### Liverpool
The absence of Mohamed Salah (Egypt) is a massive blow to Liverpool, as the forward is currently joint-top of the Premier League scoring charts. Wataru Endo (Japan) is another key departure for Liverpool heading to the Asian Cup.

### Luton
Issa Kaboré (Burkina Faso) leaves a positive impression as he departs, having made a significant impact on loan from Manchester City.

### Manchester City
Remarkably, Manchester City has no international absentees, signaling a strong and uninterrupted campaign ahead.

### Manchester United
André Onana (Cameroon) will join his compatriots after being granted permission to play in United's league game against Tottenham, ensuring his availability for AFCON.

### Newcastle
Although Newcastle does not have players participating in AFCON or the Asian Cup, they are linked with a potential January move for Boulaye Dia from Salernitana.

### Nottingham Forest
Nottingham Forest faces a considerable exodus, losing six players to AFCON. Key figures like Serge Aurier, Willy Boly, and Ibrahim Sangaré will represent the Ivory Coast, while Cheikhou Kouyaté, Moussa Niakhaté, and Ola Aina will be big losses for Senegal and Nigeria, respectively.

### Sheffield United
Sheffield United faces a relatively light impact, with Anis Ben Slimane (Tunisia) being the only first-team regular to depart.

### Tottenham
Tottenham faces a challenging period with the departure of essential players like Pape Sarr (Senegal), Yves Bissouma (Mali), and Son Heung-min (South Korea). The captain's absence until mid-February could significantly influence their fortunes.

### West Ham
West Ham suffers a blow with the loss of Mohammed Kudus (Ghana) and Nayef Aguerd (Morocco) at a crucial time when creativity is needed. Lucas Paquetá's injury adds to the challenges faced by David Moyes.

### Wolves
Wolves will miss key players like Hwang Hee-chan (South Korea) and Rayan Aït-Nouri (Algeria), while Boubacar Traoré (Mali) departs from the bench. The inclusion of under-21 player Justin Hubner (Indonesia) adds an interesting element to their squad.

### Conclusion
As the Premier League braces for the impact of AFCON, clubs will need to navigate through a challenging period without key players. The absence of star names like Mohamed Salah, Son Heung-min, and others will undoubtedly shape the dynamics of the league during this crucial time. It remains to be seen how the affected clubs cope with the challenges posed by the departure of their influential players.
