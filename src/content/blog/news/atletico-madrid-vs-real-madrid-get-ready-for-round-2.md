Get ready to buckle up for another thrilling round as Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid prepare to face off in the Copa del Rey last 16, and we can't contain our excitement after their Supercopa de Espana showdown just a week ago!

In their last meeting, Real Madrid emerged victorious with a 5-3 win after extra time in a jaw-dropping semi-final clash. The drama unfolded in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, setting the stage for an exhilarating encounter. Carlo Ancelotti's squad went on to lift the Supercopa de Espana, sealing the deal with a 4-1 victory over their arch-rivals Barcelona, thanks to Vinicius Junior's sensational first-half hat-trick.

Lightning might strike twice as Thursday's cup meeting returns to the iconic Wanda Metropolitano.
