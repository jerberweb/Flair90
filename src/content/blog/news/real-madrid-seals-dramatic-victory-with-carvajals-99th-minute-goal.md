In a thrilling encounter at the Santiago Bernabeu, Real Madrid faced unexpected challenges against Almeria, ultimately securing a dramatic 3-2 win with a 99th-minute goal from Dani Carvajal.



Despite being the underdogs, Almeria took an early lead within 40 seconds of kick-off, exploiting Madrid's defensive lapses. Largie Ramazani capitalized on a quick attack, neatly finishing past Kepa Arrizabalaga to shockingly put the visitors ahead.



Madrid struggled to find their rhythm in the first half, failing to register a single shot on target. Edgar Gonzalez compounded their woes with a stunning goal in the 42nd minute, making it 2-0 for Almeria. The center-back found the net with a first-time effort from the edge of the box.



Trailing 2-0, Real Madrid underwent a transformation in the second half. A Jude Bellingham penalty, earned by substitute Joselu, reduced the deficit to 2-1. Controversy ensued as Almeria seemingly extended their lead through Sergio Arribas, but a VAR check disallowed the goal due to a foul in the build-up.



The match took another contentious turn when Vinicius Junior appeared to handle the ball while scoring, yet the referee opted to award the goal after a VAR review.



In the 99th minute, with added time ticking away, Real Madrid staged a stunning comeback. Bellingham's strategic header found Dani Carvajal at the back post, and he clinically tapped in from close range to seal a 3-2 victory for Los Blancos.



The unexpected twists and turns in the game showcased the unpredictable nature of football. Real Madrid, despite facing adversity, demonstrated resilience and secured a crucial win that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the season's highlights.
