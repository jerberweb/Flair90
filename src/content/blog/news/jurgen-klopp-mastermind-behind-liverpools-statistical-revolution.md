---
Jurgen Klopp, the charismatic German at the helm of Liverpool, recently sent shockwaves through the football world by announcing his departure from the club at the end of the season. As the 56-year-old prepares for an emotional farewell, let's delve into the astonishing statistics that define his transformative reign at Anfield.

#### I. Klopp's Winning Formula

From the moment Klopp set foot at Anfield in 2015, he unleashed a brand of high-energy, relentless football that not only electrified the fans but also yielded immediate results. Klopp's win percentage is a testament to his winning machine – an impressive 62.18% in 468 matches, surpassing club legends Shankly, Paisley, and Dalglish. His impact was swift, and Liverpool supporters quickly found themselves enchanted by the German's football philosophy.

#### II. A Trophy Collection Beyond Compare

Klopp's success isn't merely measured in percentages; it's etched in silverware. With an enviable trophy cabinet, Klopp stands alone as the only Liverpool manager to lift six different trophies, including the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, and more. The correlation between his stellar win percentage and the hardware in Liverpool's trophy room is undeniable.

#### III. Resilience and Comeback Prowess

Liverpool, under Klopp's guidance, became synonymous with memorable comebacks. The Reds' ability to bounce back from losing positions is staggering – accumulating 148 points from such scenarios across Europe's top five leagues since 2015. This season, they continue to showcase their never-say-die attitude, accumulating a division-high 19 points from losing positions in the Premier League.

#### IV. Unbeatable Reds

Klopp's Liverpool rarely tastes defeat. During their 2019/20 title-winning season, the team embarked on a jaw-dropping 44-game unbeaten run in the Premier League, falling just five games short of the all-time record set by Arsenal. This remarkable streak, lasting from January 12, 2019, to February 24, 2020, saw Liverpool amass 132 points from a possible 142, showcasing their dominance.

#### V. Streaks and Records

Liverpool's achievements under Klopp include matching Man City's 2017 record with an 18-game winning streak in the 2019/20 season. This incredible run featured victories over rivals Manchester United and Everton, contributing to a season where Liverpool won 26 of their first 27 league matches.

#### VI. Achieving Glory on a Budget

Perhaps Klopp's most remarkable feat is his ability to deliver success on a budget. Despite key signings like Van Dijk and Alisson, Liverpool's net spend of £254m since Klopp's arrival pales in comparison to big-budget rivals. The German's shrewdness in the transfer market is evident, creating a competitive team without breaking the bank.

In conclusion, Klopp's departure marks the end of an era at Liverpool. His statistical marvel, from unprecedented win percentages to memorable comebacks and silverware-laden seasons, has left an indelible mark on the club. As Klopp bids farewell, Liverpool fans will forever cherish the statistical legacy he crafted during his historic tenure.
