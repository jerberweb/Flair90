The Milan Derby has always been a clash of titans, a footballing spectacle that transcends the beautiful game. However, in the annals of history, there exists a chapter that blurs the lines between intense rivalry and chaotic fervor – the 2004/05 Champions League quarterfinal between Inter Milan and AC Milan.

## A Routine Clash Turned Infernal

It started as a routine clash, a sequel to the 2002/03 Champions League semifinal where Milan had progressed on 'away' goals. In the 2004/05 quarterfinals, Milan secured a comfortable 2-0 'home' win, seemingly on their way to another victory.

As the return game unfolded, Milan took an early 1-0 lead. Little did anyone know that the San Siro would soon be engulfed in chaos.

## Flares Reign Supreme

The second half saw a surreal turn of events. Inter fans, fueled by the fervor of the rivalry, unleashed a barrage of flares onto the pitch. The beautiful green field transformed into a sea of smoke and fire as the flares continued to rain down.

Referee Markus Merk had no choice but to suspend play not once, but twice. A desperate plea echoed through the stadium speakers, urging the unruly fans to cease their chaotic display. But the flames persisted, shrouding the pitch in an eerie glow.

## Dida's Unfortunate Hit

In the midst of this flare-induced pandemonium, chaos reached its peak when Milan goalkeeper Dida was struck by a flare hurled from the crowd. The situation had spiraled out of control, and Merk had to make a difficult decision.

With the game descending into madness and the safety of players compromised, Merk abandoned the match. AC Milan, leading 1-0, was subsequently awarded a 3-0 "walkover" by UEFA.

## The Fallout: A Rivalry's Dark Chapter

While the Milan Derby had always been a cauldron of passion, this flare-induced episode marked a dark chapter in its storied history. Both Inter and AC Milan condemned the actions of the unruly fans, and UEFA, in a rare display of unanimity, supported Merk's decision.

Inter faced the consequences of their fans' actions – a £132,000/$165,000 fine and a directive to play their next four European matches behind closed doors. The repercussions were a harsh reminder that, while the rivalry fueled the passion, it should never spiral into chaos.

## The Rivalry in Numbers

The history between AC Milan and Inter Milan is a tapestry of competition, with 235 official matches painting a vivid picture. Inter holds the derby advantage with 87 wins compared to Milan's 79, along with 69 draws.

In terms of trophies, both teams boast an impressive haul, with 19 Serie A titles each. The Scudetto pendulum swings between them, adding another layer of intensity to an already fierce rivalry.

As of May 2, 2023, these statistics serve as a testament to the enduring battle for supremacy between the Rossoneri and the Nerazzurri.

## From Fervor to Reflection

While the Milan Derby's intensity is celebrated, the flare chaos serves as a cautionary tale. Football is a passion, a celebration of skill and camaraderie, but it should never devolve into a spectacle of danger.

As we revel in the excitement of rivalries, let's also remember the responsibility that comes with it. The beautiful game is a delicate balance between passion and sportsmanship. In the end, even the fiercest rivalries must be governed by the spirit of fair play.
