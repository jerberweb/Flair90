# World Cup Flashback: James Rodriguez's Unforgettable 2014 Show

*By Rahul Warrier | Published: November 18, 2022*

In the grand spectacle of the 2014 World Cup, one name that echoed globally was James Rodriguez. At just 22 years old, the Colombian dynamo left an indelible mark with a breathtaking performance that surpassed all expectations.

## The Unexpected Star

Nobody anticipated a 22-year-old Colombian to outshine established South American superstars Lionel Messi and Neymar Junior. Yet, that's the beauty of the World Cup – it unveils global stars within weeks.

Rodriguez's journey to stardom took a European turn, moving from Banfield to Porto before catching the eye of AS Monaco. His €45 million transfer fee reflected the club's belief in his potential, and Rodriguez delivered, scoring nine goals and providing 13 assists in a standout season.

## Sparkling Moments in Brazil

The 2014 World Cup showcased Rodriguez's brilliance on the grand stage. Colombia navigated a challenging group, defeating Greece, Ivory Coast, and Japan with confidence, style, and swagger.

A 3-0 win over Greece saw Rodriguez score in the 93rd minute, followed by a crucial goal against Ivory Coast in a 2-1 victory securing qualification. Rested for the final group game against Japan, he made a memorable impact, assisting two goals and scoring one in a 4-1 triumph.

## A Quarterfinal Spectacle

The knockout stage brought a tougher challenge against Uruguay in Rio de Janeiro. Rodriguez rose to the occasion, scoring two sensational goals that propelled Colombia to their first-ever quarter-final.

The first goal showcased Rodriguez's audacity, receiving a cleared ball with his back to the goal, trapping it on his chest, spinning, and volleying into the left corner. The second, five minutes into the second half, highlighted his poise and finishing ability.

## The Goal Heard Around the World

Uruguayan manager Oscar Tabarez hailed Rodriguez's opener as "one of the greatest goals the World Cup has ever seen." The volley, later voted the best goal of the tournament, clinched the FIFA Puskas Award for the best goal of the year.

Despite Colombia falling short in the quarterfinal against Brazil, Rodriguez's impact resonated. His late penalty in the 2-1 defeat showcased his determination, and he finished the tournament with the Golden Boot, scoring six goals in five games.

## Legacy and Beyond

Rodriguez's stellar World Cup performance didn't go unnoticed. Real Madrid's Florentino Perez quickly brought him to the Bernabeu, solidifying his status as a global football sensation. In those scorching three weeks in Brazil, James Rodriguez not only wrote himself into World Cup lore but also secured his place as one of football's brightest stars.
